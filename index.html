      <p> The condition of the world 500 years from today is completely fog-covered.The world seems to be covered in a vast veil of smoke. The sun rises and sets—but no one notices. People move like machines, following a fixed rhythm.</p>

       <p> No one laughs, no one cries. Everyone seems trapped within an invisible rule. In the morning, they wake up, work at designated times, and sleep at night. No questions, no thoughts—just flowing with the current.But there is one person who exists outside this flow… </p>

        <p>Her name is Lili, the daughter of a 300-year-old scientist. 
          In front of her eyes, this mechanical world keeps turning, but her mind can never truly adapt to it. <br/>
  
        
          Her father used to tell her many things related to science, like light, dimension, and time. She always pondered over those topics—
          <ul>
            <li><q>Why are we all moving in the same way?</q></li>
            <li> <q>Are we really three-dimensional?</q></li>
            <li><q>If we can understand the third dimension, then what is the fourth dimension?</q></li>
            <li><q>Are we just a part of this world, or is someone controlling us?</q></li>
              <li> <q>Is there something beyond this fog?</q></li>
          </ul>
         
        </p>
        <p>
          Lili's friends think she is crazy, but these questions keep revolving in her mind.</p>
          <p>
          Every night, when the entire city falls asleep, Ara sits by the window, staring into the fog. She can feel that something exists beyond it... but what?</p>

            <div style="width: 900px;height: 400px;color:rgb(54, 3, 3);margin: 20px;">

            
          
          <p>One night, under the moonlight, the fog thins, the wind stands still, and time seems to pause for a moment. And then, she sees it—
            a shadowy figure standing there! But its body looks strangely transparent, as if it is both here and not here at the same time! Yet, it is not human… it seems like something from another world.
            </p><p>
            Suddenly, a strange voice echoes—
            The shadowy figure says, <b>"You can see us because you have learned to think."</b> 
            </p> 
            lili is stunned!
            <p></p>
            Before her eyes, a new world unfolds—one that cannot be seen with ordinary vision. Time flows differently there, objects behave in unusual ways, and some creatures float—
            as if gravity has no control over them!</p>

            <p>The shadowy figure says, We come from the fourth dimension, where even time can bend. To you, time flows in only one direction, but for us, it can move both forward and backward.<br/>

              Lili, in astonishment, asks, Then, does that mean you created us?
            <br/>
              The shadowy figure smiles and replies, Just as you can imagine three-dimensional beings, we imagine  and understand you. But that doesn’t mean we are your gods. <br/>
              <p>
              Lili struggles to understand—If they are not our gods, then who is? And is someone controlling them too? Or is there something beyond even them? </p>
              Lili realizes that she is standing before a great truth. Behind this fog lies a hidden world, one that no one has ever imagined. But there’s only one problem—those who see this world can never return to the one they came from!</p>
