          <p>Her name is Lili, the daughter of a 300-year-old scientist. 
            In front of her eyes, this mechanical world keeps turning, but her mind can never truly adapt to it. <br/>
    
            Her father used to tell her many things related to science, like light, dimension, and time. She always pondered over those topics—
            <ul>
              <li><q>Why are we all moving in the same way?</q></li>
              <li> <q>Are we really three-dimensional?</q></li>
              <li><q>If we can understand the third dimension, then what is the fourth dimension?</q></li>
              <li><q>Are we just a part of this world, or is someone controlling us?</q></li>
                <li> <q>Is there something beyond this fog?</q></li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            Lili's friends think she is crazy, but these questions keep revolving in her mind.</p>
            <p>
            Every night, when the entire city falls asleep, Ara sits by the window, staring into the fog. She can feel that something exists beyond it... but what?</p>
